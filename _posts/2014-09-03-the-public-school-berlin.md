*Revolution is also a Language, The Public School Berlin, October 2013*

Initiated in Los Angeles in 2007 by Telic Arts Exchange, the project exists in several places world-wide and in Berlin since the fall of 2010. A school with no curriculum, [The Public School](http://thepublicschool.org/) is a framework that supports autodidactic activities: it is not accredited, it does not give out degrees, and it has no affiliation with the public school system. Hosted by PROGRAM for the first year all classes take place at Archive Kabinett in Berlin Kreuzberg since early 2012.
