Workshop with Sean Dockray and Caleb Waldorf at Gertrude Contemporary in Melbourne in March 2014.

The workshop at Gertrude Contemporary assessed our (artists, writers, curators, academics, etc.) ongoing relationships with cultural institutions of varying scales. The focus was oriented towards how institutional frameworks impact and inform our practices in an ongoing manner, from the perspective of the day to day activities that comprise our work. The conversation departed from the opposition and the resistance mobilized against the Sydney Biennial’s funding by Transfield and the subsequent repercussions, both known and speculative. The desire was to connect the situation taking place in this context to a broader set of concerns facing many who work within, and rely on, contemporary cultural infrastructures.

As output of the workshop participants decided to create a reader related to topics around corporate funding, alternative institutions, and the social impact of art. Over the course of one week, we collected the group’s contributions for seven chapters that emerged during our discussion. Without having a precise goal this collection called TiNNN could be followed by an annotated publication, be a starting point of a series of public events in different places, or serve as compilation for further discussions – in Melbourne and elsewhere.
