Sound Performance at Eternithaus in Berlin Tiergarten in May 2011.

Steve Rowell’s “Hollow Earth” imports sounds from distant underground spaces to the Tiergarten. Utilizing the translucent glass box of the Eternithaus building as a resonant medium, Rowell displaces the listener by amplifying these recorded, remote room tones, thereby de-contextualizing the present, physical space. This experience – perceived shifting thresholds of hearing and imagined sound source location – is designed as a psychoacoustic exercise. The non-site of the event space becomes a mere reference point for other places far removed from the listener’s immediate experience.
