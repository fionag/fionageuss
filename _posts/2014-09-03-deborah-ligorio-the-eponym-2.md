On the occasion of [\[the EPONYM\]](http://www.theeponym.net) artist Deborah Ligorio has selected titles inspiring her project that started with an internal workshop at Archive Kabinett in April 2014. The collection is meant to be shared for individual or collective reading and is also made available on [AAAAAARG](http://aaaaarg.org/collection/53513f68334fe007892169f0).
