The event space *Salon Populaire* in Berlin Schöneberg invited each week one or more guests to interpret its spatial appearance, experiment with formats and shape an audience. Its self-organized structure, the blurring of hierarchies between host, guest and audience as well as the flexible props created in collaboration with *raumlabor berlin* challenged the representative character of the former bourgeois representational space located at *Kunstsaele Berlin*. The events ranged from small conversation groups to open discussions, from cinema evenings to film installations, performances and concerts. Besides one-off events a number of series were devoted to individual themes over a longer period of time. The thematic dinner evenings *Can you pass the Salt, please?* developed in collaboration with Fotini Lazaridou-Hatzigoga experimented with the dinner party as a conversational format. In the course of discussions about the connections between Berlin institutions the series Bethanien Residents evolved in collaboration with Künstlerhaus Bethanien.
