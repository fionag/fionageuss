Alex Martinis Roe’s exhibition *A story from Circolo della Rosa* at [Archive Kabinett](http://www.archivekabinett.org) in March 2014 continues her work on feminist genealogies. The film weaves together fragments from her recent oral history research with members of [Libreria delle donne](http://www.libreriadelledonne.it/) and her experiences of their collective activities, as well as her exploration of related spaces, archives and texts.

On the occasion of the show Alex Martinis Roe selected a series of books from both her personal library and the Milan Women’s Bookstore. The collection takes the form of an open access reference library at Archive Kabinett inviting users for individual or collective reading, serving as site for sharing resources and ways of thinking. Excerpts from this collection will also be made available on [AAAAARG.ORG](http://aaaaarg.org/collection/5300fc073078882f02000024).

*The show was organized by Fiona Geuss and it was made possible with support by Graduiertenschule, Universität der Künste Berlin.*
